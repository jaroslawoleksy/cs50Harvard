1.  GIF
2.  Lossy - reducing the size of the file the quality of the image is also reduced.
    Loseless - reducing the file size doesn't affect the quality of the image.
3.  JPEG
4.  The file is not phisically removed - the system only changes the first letter of the file name and moves the clusters of the file
    to the list of free clusters on the hard drive.
5.  You should sanitaze the disk with some tool. The best way is to overwrite all the data on the hard drive so it cannot be recovered.
6.  stdint.h is a header file that allows us to use the special int types (intN_t and uintN_t)
7.  They are used to declare exact-width integers. 
8.  1, 4, 4, 2
9.  0x42 0x4d (BM)
10. bfSize is the size of the file in bytes,
    biSize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct in bytes (40 bytes in our case),
11. biHight is negative for top-down bitmaps with its origin in the upper-left corner
12. biBitCount,
13. it could happen if the system fails to create the outfile file.
14. it's because we want to write BITMAPFILEHEADER and BITMAPINFOHEADER just one time
    and then copy the bitmap pixel by pixel (3 bytes each time),
15. 3
    (4 - (9 % 4)) % 4 = (4 - 1) % 4 = 3 % 4 = 3
16. it skips over the given padding in the input file
17. SEEK_CUR is the current position of the file pointer
